# Connecting-the-Dots

2010-2015 international migration network data from the primary analyses of McMillan 2024. An adjacency matrix of directed, weighted migration flows from 2010 to 2015 is available in migrant_flow_adjmat_2010_2015.csv. The value of each (_i_,_j_) cell indicates the number of people born in country _i_ who moved to country _j_ between 2010 to 2015. Countries are presented in alphabetical order. These data are from Abel, G. J. (2018). Estimates of global bilateral migration flows by gender between 1960 and 20151. _International Migration Review_, 52(3), 809-852.

Node-level characteristics are presented in country_attributes.csv. See the Data section in McMillan 2024 for more details about the variables included and the sources of all data. 

There are also several matrices that include data on the pairwise characteristics of countries. Countries are presented in alphabetical order in the rows and columns of these matrices. borders_mat.csv indicates whether a country pair shares a land border. colonialism_mat.csv indicates pairs of countries where one colonized the other. country_dist_mat.csv provides the shortest physical distance between each country pair. migrant_stock_2010.csv indicates how many people born in country _i_ lived in country _j_ at the start of 2010. remit_mat_2010.csv provides information on flows of remittances between countries. See the Data section in McMillan 2024 for more details about the variables included and the sources of all data.
